## Description

* I decided to make a Landing Page for an app called MedRec, which is
a Electronic Healthcare Management System, that offers acces and manipulations with Medical Records via an Online Platform. 

* I followed the requirements and implemented several sections:
    * Navbar - I designed a navbar with the logo of the application and several CTA (Call to Action) Buttons that provide links to several sections in the page.
    * Hero - in this Section I displayed some Hero Text alongside with an image that reflects the general purpose and will catch the eye of the customer.

    * Overview - a small section with 3 main features / solved problems that may interest customers.

    * Demo Functionality - in this Section I present to users the functionalities of the application with their respective demo images, and provide small description of them.

    ![alt-text-5](readme_images/demo_3.png "title-5") 
    * Social Proof - a section with social proof of the application, that includes several rankings of the app from different sources and a series of Testimonials from Customers of the app.

    * Contact Form - this form presents a way to gain access to the application via a register form.

* At the same time, I tried to implement responsiveness using @media queries in order to have a better display on small media devices:
    * Navbar and Hero

    * Contact Form

## Conclusions
* I used only HTML and CSS in order to accomplish the task. I got in touch with many functionalities of CSS, understood better styling techniques available in CSS, such as: Hover effect, background gradient and many others.
